# this is basically app to learn React hooks, learned HOOKS-useState()

- So create a functional component called SearchWiki 
- Added Bootstrap CDN link 
- Added a Textbox with search button
- When user clicks the Search button make an HTTP request to wiki API using AXIOS. 
- Search results are displayed in bootstrap ListGroup and then link is provided to Wiki 

# TODO

- Deploy this to Heroku 
- Implement useEffect() hook
- Implement autocomplete in search textbox. It need to debounce :)
